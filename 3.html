  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, 
    is a programming language <strong>that is one of the <u>core technologies of the World Wide Web</u></strong></a>, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 
    98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. 
    It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, 
    supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) 
    for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
